Probably the introduction helped you sketch a scenario, if not then lets have it.

Life is an aspiration and it's mission is to strive. It will take you where it wants and when it wants. So was the thing with me, from the confluence my stream diverged towards Electronics and Computer Engineering although I expected it to take the way of medicines. Life always has a better plan for us, all we need to do is have confidence in heart and move ahead.

We can't tell whether a fruit is sweet or sour without tasting it. Similarly, to know the taste of coding first I had to try it. The fact that lured me in is that may it be medicine or machine, it's all about science, and at some point they are interlinked.


Regular course weren't enough to give me the true essence of this new field so just thought of trying something out of box, i.e started exploring this arena with amFOSS tasks that are mentioned in further posts.
